ArConnect allows you to upload any webpage to the Arweave with just a few clicks

You can do so by:

- Go to the webpage you want to upload to Arweave

- In your browser, select the Print option (generally in your browser settings menu)

- On the Print screen options, in the Destination field, select Print to Arweave (screenshot below)

- Click the Print button

- ArConnect will show a pop up to review and confirm the upload transaction

    - If the webpage upload is less than 100kb, there will be no Arweave network fee to pay

    - If the webpage upload is more than 100kb, there will be an Arweave network fee to pay. The network fee will vary depending on the size of the upload. Make sure you have AR Tokens in your wallet to the network fee, if necessary

- If the transaction is successful, you will be able to see it in your Transaction History in your ArConnect wallet.

- Click on Viewblock in the transaction details to view the upload on Arweave.
