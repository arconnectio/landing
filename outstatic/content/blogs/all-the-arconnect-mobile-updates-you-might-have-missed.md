The latest ArConnect mobile update includes several major changes to both functionality and interface. This update focuses on simplifying the user experience while adding long-awaited features like app connections.

Following extensive user feedback and ecosystem growth, the team has redesigned core interactions and added new capabilities. Moving away from the previous layout that prominently featured the AR token, the new version adapts to an ecosystem with multiple active tokens and apps. Here's what's different:

**Dashboard Changes**

The dashboard has been completely redesigned with a focus on simplifying daily interactions and token management:

- AR token is now listed with other tokens instead of having a dedicated spot at the top

- Real-time AO token balance updates (tap the balance for detailed view)

- Four main actions at the top: Send, Receive, Buy, and Scan

- Wallet addresses can be copied directly from the wallet switcher

The token management system has been rebuilt to increase token visibility and reduce management complexity:

- Toggle switches replace the previous swipe-to-hide system

- New tokens are automatically detected

- Manual token import available via process ID

- NFTs now display under a dedicated collectibles tab

- Transaction history moved to an activity feed with infinite scroll

Users can now connect to Arweave and AO applications directly through their phones. The new interface includes a URL bar that doubles as an explore page, allowing users to browse apps by category or search for specific applications. The ArConnect mobile app now provides standard web browsing capabilities and includes a tab system where users can favorite frequently accessed apps. To help users identify permanent applications, a purple checkmark indicates when an app is Arweave-based.

When connecting to apps, users can:

- Customize individual app permissions

- Choose between auto-sign or manual transaction review

- View detailed transaction information before signing

- Use biometric authentication

- Manage connected apps in settings

**Settings Organization**

The settings menu has been reorganized:

- Fewer main categories

- Connected apps section added

- Preferences consolidated into one section

- Reset and sign-out options more accessible

**For Developers**

The new update maintains compatibility with existing ArConnect integrations, requiring no modifications from developers. The app has evolved to function as a Permaweb browser, and developers can get their apps added to the explore section by reaching out through Discord. An archive feature, similar to the "print to Permaweb" function in the browser extension, is scheduled for release by the end of December.
