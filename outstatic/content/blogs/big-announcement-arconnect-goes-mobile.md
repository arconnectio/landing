ArConnect, the community-built wallet, has come a long way since its humble beginnings as a weekend project. It was created to solve a simple but significant problem: the hassle of dragging and dropping private keys just to log into Arweave applications. Fast forward to today, and ArConnect has become the go-to wallet for the Arweave and AO ecosystem, with a core focus on security plus organic growth driven by meeting a critical user need.

From its inception, ArConnect has been the first point of contact for many users entering the Arweave ecosystem. It's now the leading wallet in the ecosystem, with easy API integration and tools that make it indispensable for developers. To date, millions of AR tokens have passed through ArConnect, and 95% of applications in the Arweave ecosystem are utilizing it.

Because ArConnect was built to address community needs, listening to user feedback is crucial in shaping its roadmap. We strive to consistently enhance the wallet's features and functionality based on what our community values most.

**The Big Announcement**

Today, we’re excited to announce that ArConnect is officially available on mobile! You can now download the app from the Apple AppStore or Google Play for seamless access to Arweave and AO, the infinitely scalable decentralized platform. With a secure, lightweight wallet, you can now explore the growing AO ecosystem with ease.

ArConnect has always been your companion throughout your Arweave journey. Now, it's even closer—right in your pocket and at your fingertips.

**Key Features of ArConnect Mobile**

Some of the exciting new features include:

- FaceID Login: Secure and easy access with facial recognition.

- Seamless Migration: Transfer your wallet to mobile by scanning a custom QR code from the browser extension.

- Push Notifications: Stay up to date with real-time notifications directly on your phone.

- And of course, many of the features you know and love from ArConnect are still here, with more coming soon.

**Amplifying Arweave and AO Principles**

The AO and Arweave ecosystem stands out for its commitment to accessibility and availability for everyone. It's not just groundbreaking technology but a platform that protects people's rights in the digital world. With three major superpowers—permissionless, ownership, and interoperability—the AO and Arweave ecosystem is a bastion of digital freedom.

ArConnect’s mission is to ensure that users can experience all Arweave has to offer, with an emphasis on security, simplicity, and trust. With the mobile app now available, we hope to empower even more users to explore the full potential of Arweave and AO.
