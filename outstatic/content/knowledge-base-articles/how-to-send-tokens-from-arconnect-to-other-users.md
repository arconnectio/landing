Follow these steps to send tokens to other users from ArConnect:

1. Open ArConnect.

2. Click on the "Send" icon within the ArConnect extension’s main view.

3. Click on the "Select Recipient" dropdown menu.

4. Choose from "Recents", "Contacts", or enter a new Arweave address or ArNS name.

5. After selecting the recipient, click "Add" to confirm.

6. Input the amount you wish to send. By default, the input is in AR.

    - A preview of the amount in USD is displayed just below the input.

    - To specify a specific amount in USD and transfer the equivalent AR, toggle the USD/AR option.

    - Click "Max" if you wish to transfer all funds from your wallet. This automatically selects the maximum amount available for transfer, excluding network fees.

    - If you intend to transfer an alternate token, select the token from the dropdown menu before setting the transfer amount.

    <!-- -->

7. Proceed by clicking on the "Next" button.

8. Review the transaction details in the confirm transaction screen.

9. After reviewing, click “Confirm” to process the transaction.

    - Wait a few seconds for the transaction to be picked up by the gateway and complete its execution.

    <!-- -->

10. On successful transaction execution, the extension displays a receipt with the details of the transfer.

    - The receipt includes a link to view the transaction on the Viewblock explorer.

        > ⚠️ Miners still have to mine the transaction at this point and hence it may take some time to be updated on Viewblock.

    - When transacting with an unsaved address, the receipt also provides and option to add the recipient as contact.

        - Clicking the link redirects you to the contact creation flow within the Settings page to help you quickly add the recipient as a contact. See our guide on [adding a contact](https://www.notion.so/755217db1fa248bcae1831c7b01cba93?pvs=21) to learn more.
