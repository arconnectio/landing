    - A preview of the amount in USD is displayed just below the input.

    - To specify a specific amount in USD and transfer the equivalent AR, toggle the USD/AR option.

    - Click "Max" if you wish to transfer all funds from your wallet. This automatically selects the maximum amount available for transfer, excluding network fees.

    - If you intend to transfer an alternate token, select the token from the dropdown menu before setting the transfer amount.

    - Wait a few seconds for the transaction to be picked up by the gateway and complete its execution.

10. On successful transaction execution, the extension displays a receipt with the details of the transfer.

    - The receipt includes a link to view the transaction on the Viewblock explorer.

        > ⚠️ Miners still have to mine the transaction at this point and hence it may take some time to be updated on Viewblock.

    - When transacting with an unsaved address, the receipt also provides and option to add the recipient as contact.

        ![](/images/screen-shot-2024-03-27-at-11.23.32-pm-YxOD.png)

        - Clicking the link redirects you to the contact creation flow within the Settings page to help you quickly add the recipient as a contact. See our guide on [adding a contact](https://www.notion.so/755217db1fa248bcae1831c7b01cba93?pvs=21) to learn more.
