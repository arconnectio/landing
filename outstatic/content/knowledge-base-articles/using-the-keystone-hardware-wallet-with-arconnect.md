Note - The Keystone integration is only available with the ArConnect Browser Extension.

## What is Keystone?

- Keystone is a cold storage for your wallet.

- It adds another layer of security, on top of Arweave.

- It is cut off from the internet.

- It uses biometric and hardware protection.

- Learn more at [https://keyst.one](https://keyst.one/).

## How to use Keystone with ArConnect?

- Before starting:

    - Watch this in-depth tutorial: [https://support.keyst.one/3rd-party-wallets/arweave-wallets/arconnect](https://support.keyst.one/3rd-party-wallets/arweave-wallets/arconnect)

    - What’s required: Up to date multicoin firmware.

    <!-- -->

- Head over to settings ⇒ wallets ⇒ add wallet.

- Click “Connect keystone”.

- On keystone, go to “Software Wallet” ⇒ ”ArConnect”.

- Tap “…” and “Connect Software Wallet”.

- Scan the displayed QR code with the scanner that appeared within ArConnect, after clicking “Connect keystone”.

- Let ArConnect load the wallet. This might take a few seconds, because ArConnect has to scan multiple frames of QR codes.
