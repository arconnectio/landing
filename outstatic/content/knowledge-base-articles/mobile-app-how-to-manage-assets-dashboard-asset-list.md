ArConnect gives users the ability to have a complete overview of their AR and AO assets. Any new AO asset that an ArConnect user receives will automatically be added to the Asset list once confirmed on chain.

On the main Dashboard screen, ArConnect users can view the following:

- View AR Token balance - AR Token amounts are listed at the top of the dashboard along with a balance chart

- View AO Tokens - A list of your top 5 AO assets ranked by asset balance amount.

Users can access their full token list by clicking the View All button above the AO Token list.

In the full AO assets list, ArConnect users can view the following:

- All AO assets that have at least one transaction

- Balances for all AO assets that have at least one transaction

- Assets the user has hidden from the main AO assets list

In the full AO assets list, ArConnect users can manage the following:

- Send any asset by clicking on the asset

- Hide assets by swiping swiping left on the asset and clicking the eyeball

- View asset settings by swiping lift on the asset and clicking the setting gear

- Import an AO asset by clicking the Import Asset button

- Unhide an asset by going to the Hidden Assets list, swiping left on the asset and clicking the eyeball
