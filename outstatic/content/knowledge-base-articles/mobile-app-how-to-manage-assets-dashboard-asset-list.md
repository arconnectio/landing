ArConnect gives users the ability to have a complete overview of their AR and AO assets. Any new AO asset that an ArConnect user receives will automatically be added to the Asset list once confirmed on chain.

On the main Dashboard screen, ArConnect users can view the balance for all their AR Token and AO Tokens.

Users can access their full token list by clicking the Manage asset list button at the bottom of their token list

In the full AR & AO assets list, ArConnect users can view the following:

- All AO assets that have at least one transaction

- Balances for all AO assets that have at least one transaction

- Assets the user has hidden from the main AO assets list

In the full AR & AO assets list, ArConnect users can manage the following:

- Remove an asset from the Dashboard by enabling or disabling the toggle for the specific asset

- Import an AO asset by clicking the Import Asset button
