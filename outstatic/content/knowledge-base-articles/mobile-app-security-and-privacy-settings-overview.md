ArConnect Mobile lets users customize the security and privacy settings. Any setting can be adjusted to fit the user's preference.

The Security and Privacy settings can be accessed by:

- Open ArConnect Mobile.

- Click the Settings button (hamburger menu) in the upper left hand corner of the dashboard.

- Select *Security & Privacy* in the Setting's Menu.

The following *Security & Privacy* settings can be customized:

- Transfer settings - Set the amount that requires you to enter your password to send assets.

- Biometrics settings - Enable or disable biometrics for when a password is asked for.

- Fee multiplier - Increase or decrease the network fee limit for transactions. Increasing the fee makes it more likely your transaction gets confirmed in the next block.

- Analytics - Turn off or on autonomous analytic trackings.
