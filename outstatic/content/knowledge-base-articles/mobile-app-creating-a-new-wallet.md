ArConnect is a self custody wallet for the Arweave and AO blockchain ecosystem. Self-custody is when the user controls their private keys themselves, taking full responsibility for the security of the wallet. This means, there is no reset password option or support services if a user forgets their password or loses access to their wallet.

When creating an ArConnect wallet or any self custody wallet, it is extremely important to carefully complete each step during the set up and save critical information when prompted.
