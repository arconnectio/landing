ArConnect users may need to create or import additional wallets for various reasons and are able to do so directly in the Mobile App Settings after finishing onboarding.

Important note - Every wallet created will have its own seedphrase and address. Multiple addresses can not be derived from the same seedphrase.

ArConnect users can create or import additional wallets by:

- Opening the ArConnect Mobile App

- Click on the Settings menu in the upper left hand corner of the Dashboard

- Select Wallet Settings under the Wallet section at the top of the Settings screen

- Click the *Add a wallet* button at the bottom of the Wallet Setting screen

- Select *Create a new wallet*,* Seedphrase or Keyfile*, or *QR Code*

    - Instructions for each option are below

    <!-- -->

**Create a new wallet**

- Click the Create a new wallet option on the Add a wallet screen

- Backup your wallet by copying your new wallet’s seedphrase

    - IMPORTANT - You will only be shown your 12 word seed phrase once. Saving your 12 word seed phrase is the most important security and recovery step you can take in protecting your wallet. Never share it with anyone.

    <!-- -->

- Confirm your seedphrase

- Enter the password of your ArConnect Mobile App

- Your new wallet has been created

- Finished

**Import an additional wallet via QR Code**

- Click the QR Code option on the Add a wallet screen

    - IMPORTANT - If you haven’t already, make sure to grant the ArConnect Mobile App the ability to use your mobile device’s camera. If you don’t, you will not be able to import via QR Code

    <!-- -->

- Open your ArConnect browser extension

- In the browser extension, go to the Settings

- In the browser extension Settings screen, select Wallets

- In the browser extension Wallet List screen, select the wallet you would like to add to the mobile app

- In the browser extension Wallet Setting screen, click the Generate QR Code button and enter the password to your ArConnect browser extension wallet

- With your ArConnect Mobile App, scan the Wallet QR code from your browser extension

- Enter the password of your ArConnect Mobile App

- Your wallet has now been imported

- Finished

**Import an additional wallet via Seedphrase or Keyfile**

- Click the Seedphrase or Keyfile option on the Add a wallet screen

- By Seedphrase

    - Enter your twelve word seedphrase and then click next

    <!-- -->

- By Keyfile

    - Select “Import Keyfile” button

    - Select the Keyfile of the wallet you want to add

    - Confirm you want to add the wallet

    <!-- -->
