## Introduction

- Adding a token ⇒ can be done by any application.

- The app need not be connected to ArConnect.

- However, the app must support the addition of tokens. [Viewblock](https://viewblock.io/arweave) is generally a good option to discover and add tokens.

> ⚠️ By default, ArConnect does not show any tokens owned by the user except the main AR token balance.

## **What is Viewblock?**

- Viewblock is a block explorer that provides comprehensive insights about the Arweave network.

- Here’s some examples of details Viewblock provides:

    - Information about transactions like status, value, creator, receipient, tags, etc.

    - Details about tokens like balances, associated transactions, and other relevant data.

    - View of wallet addresses, their transaction histories, token holdings, etc.

- Its role is similar to that of Etherscan for Ethereum.

## **How to add a token to ArConnect from Viewblock?**

- ArConnect allows you to view and manage various tokens holdings on Arweave.

- By adding a token to ArConnect, you view and interact with your tokens through the ArConnect main screen itself rather than navigating to multiple platforms.

- As Viewblock has a comprehensive overview of all the tokens on Arweave, it is a good source to find and add tokens to ArConnect.

- Follow these steps to add a token from Viewblock:

    1. Make sure [ArConnect is installed and set up](https://www.notion.so/How-to-install-and-setup-ArConnect-bd56c8cf4d3949c8b8343534a5636547?pvs=21).

    2. Go to [Viewblock](https://viewblock.io/arweave).

    3. In the navigation sidebar located on the left hand side of the page, click “Tokens” ([Viewblock - Tokens](https://viewblock.io/arweave/tokens)) or search for a specific token with the search input located at the top of the page.![](/images/screen-shot-2024-03-27-at-10.48.22-pm-Q4ND.png)

## How to fix token not showing up correctly?

- Each time a token is added to the extension, ArConnect tries to guess what type of token is it (asset or collectible).

    1. Open ArConnect.

    2. Click the “settings” icon on the extension’s main view.

    3. Select the “Tokens” setting from the sidebar.
