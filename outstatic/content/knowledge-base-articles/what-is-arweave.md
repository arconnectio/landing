Arweave is a global network storing data and information. Its unique solution in the realm of decentralized storage ensures the integrity and permanence of the data stored on it.

## **How Arweave works (a high-level overview)**

- It matches people who need storage with miners who have storage to spare.

- It rewards these miners for storing data and incentivizes them to keep storing it.

- It uses much less computing power than other blockchains, making it greener and more efficient.

## Projects and Initiatives that use Arweave

Arweave's distinctive features have drawn a wide array of projects and initiatives within its ecosystem. Here are some noteworthy accomplishments that highlight the diverse utility of Arweave:
