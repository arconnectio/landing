As ArConnect is a self-custodial crypto wallet, the ArConnect team cannot access or retrieve any of your data. See [security best practices](https://www.notion.so/Security-Best-Practices-f6a81643c2694376ba433d123f63ce27?pvs=21) for keeping your wallet safe.

***Lost Password:***

- After a period of inactivity, ArConnect locks itself. You will be prompted to unlock the wallet.

    1. Uninstall ArConnect browser extension and [reinstall](https://www.notion.so/How-to-install-and-setup-ArConnect-bd56c8cf4d3949c8b8343534a5636547?pvs=21).

    2. You will be prompted with the following page. Click **I have a wallet**.

    3. Create a secure password. Remember to store your password in a password manager to prevent losing it.

    4. Provide your 12-word passphrase seed.

    5. Youâ€™re all good to go! Wallet can be accessed again.

***Lost Seed Phrase:***

The ArConnect team unfortunately cannot assist if you lose your seed phrase.

You can only create another wallet. It is a very unfortunate incident.

We recommend to pay attention to [security best practices](https://www.notion.so/Security-Best-Practices-f6a81643c2694376ba433d123f63ce27?pvs=21).
