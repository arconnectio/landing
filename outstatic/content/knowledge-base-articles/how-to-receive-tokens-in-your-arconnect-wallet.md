There are three ways for receiving tokens in your ArConnect wallet. A recipient can be selected by their Arweave and AO wallet address or a QR code.

## Receive tokens by Arweave and AO address

Each Arweave wallet is associated with an Arweave and AO address. Here are some details about Arweave wallet addresses:

- The address doesn’t necessary start with “0x” like on other chains.

- The address is exactly 43 characters long.

- It can only include normal and capitalized letters, number, “-” and “\_”.

- Addresses are case sensitive.

You can receive any type of Arweave tokens on this address.

> ⚠️ Remember: you cannot receive tokens from Ethereum or any other chain. Arweave and AO are its own chain, meaning that you cannot hold tokens from other blockchains. However, you can use the same address for Arweave and AO assets

To copy your address:

- Open the ArConnect browser extension.

- Click on the copy icon next to your wallet name/address at the top of the screen, on the ArConnect extension’s main view.

You can receive tokens with the copied address.

## Receive tokens by ANS name (.ar) name

If you have an ANS name associated with your address, you can receive tokens with that as well.

> ⚠️ Make sure the platform where you’re receiving tokens from supports ANS.

## Receive tokens by QR code

If you want to quickly receive tokens and the platform you’re receiving your tokens from supports QR codes, you can share your address faster by a QR code in ArConnect.

Follow these steps to fetch a QR code for your wallet:

1. Open ArConnect.

2. Click the button with the “Receive” icon on the ArConnect extension’s main view.

3. You’ll be able to see the QR code containing your address.

The sender can scan this QR code to send tokens to the associated wallet address.
