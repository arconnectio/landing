Sending Arweave or AO assets to another person or application is a simple process. The three pieces of information needed to complete a successful transfer:

1. The recipient‚Äôs Arweave address

2. The Arweave or AO asset that you are sending

3. The amount of the asset you want to transfer

4. AR Tokens (if transferring on the Arweave network)\*

*\*When you make a transaction on the Arweave network, you need to pay a very small transaction fee (\~<$0.01). The transaction fee is paid in AR tokens. Therefore, you always need a very small amount of AR tokens in your wallet in order to transact on the Arweave network.*

Once you have those three pieces of information, you can follow the steps below to complete a successful transfer.

1. Open the ArConnect mobile app

2. On your dashboard, click the Send button

3. Enter in the Arweave address of the recipient, then click Next

4. On the bottom of the next screen, select the Arweave or AO asset you want to transfer

5. Enter in the amount of the Arweave or AO asset you want to transfer

    1. If you want input the amount using fiat, click the üîÉ under the amount field to switch between fiat and Arweave or AO asset

    <!-- -->

6. Add a note (optional)

7. Click the Next button

8. Review all the information on the screen to make sure it is correct. If it is correct, click Confirm to finalize and send the transfer

    1. If the information is incorrect, click the ‚¨ÖÔ∏è arrow

    <!-- -->

9. If the transfer is successful, you will see a transaction confirmation screen which includes a transaction ID. A transaction ID can be used to track the status of the transaction on chain

    1. All your successful transactions will show in the transaction history section on your Dashboard so you track and review all your transactions

    <!-- -->

10. Finished
