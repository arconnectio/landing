### Why do you need to download ArConnect from an extension/add-on store?

- ArConnect is a browser extension, meaning that you need to add it to your browser to function.

- ArConnect uses the available browser APIs to create a secure environment for your favorite dApps to operate within.

- These extension stores provide security and verify all extensions submitted to them. The Chrome Extension Store is operated by Google, while the Firefox Add-on Store is operated by Mozilla (Firefox‚Äôs parent company).

- You‚Äôll be able to update and/or uninstall ArConnect here in the future.

## Setup

- Once ArConnect is installed, it will open the onboarding/setup page. You can also open this page manually by clicking the extension or its icon in the extensions list of your browser.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è We recommend pinning the extension for easier access to your wallet when using dApps.

- Follow these steps to complete the setup:

    1. The setup page will look something like this. If you already have an Arweave wallet, you can click ‚ÄúI have a wallet‚Äù to load in your existing private key/ seed phrase. If you don‚Äôt have one, click ‚ÄúGet me started‚Äù. This will bring you to a page, where you can learn the basics about ArConnect, Arweave and the permaweb or skip the intro.

    2. Next, you need to create a password. This will be used to encrypt your wallets within the extension.

    3. If you‚Äôre not loading an existing wallet, the extension will now show you your 12 word seedphrase. This will be the primary way of loading your wallet.

        > üö® Consider the following precautions when working with seedphrases:
        > 
        > - The seedphrase is a set of words that can be used to regenerate your private key. And thus, access your wallet/s.
        > 
        > - Hence, the seedphrase must be treated like a password.
        > 
        > - Do not share it with anyone.
        > 
        > - Write it down on a piece of paper.
        > 
        > - We recommend you to also download your keyfile, which holds your actual private key (an RSA JWK). This serves as an additional backup.
        > 
        > 
        > <!-- -->

    4. On the next screen, you‚Äôll need to confirm your seedphrase. Word suggestions will make this a faster and easier process for you.

    5. Next you can choose your UI theme (dark/light/automatic). You can change this later in the settings.

    6. And you‚Äôre ready! Click ‚ÄúDone‚Äù to finish the setup.

    <!-- -->

    You‚Äôll now be able to use ArConnect with dApps, as well as to manage your assets. To open the wallet extension‚Äôs main page, click ArConnect icon in your extensions list, or its icon if you‚Äôve pinned it previously.
