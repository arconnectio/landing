The Permaweb is a permanent and decentralized web built on top of Arweave and AO.

- Unlike the traditional web, where information and applications can be altered, censored or even removed, Permaweb ensures resilience.

The Permaweb works well with the traditional web we use daily.

- It has special gateways that help connect the two, allowing access to data and apps on the Permaweb just like any other website.

- This makes it easy for anyone to use, even if they're not tech-savvy, blending the new with the familiar.

Permaweb applications

- The permaweb is not only capable of store files, but also websites and applications.

- Gateways match application assets and serve it to the user.

- The applications can use ArConnect and other wallets to communicate with the users’ wallets.

## Development on the Permaweb

Here’s the stack you need to develop applications on the Permaweb;

- [Arweave Cookbook](https://cookbook.arweave.dev/): A curated collection of developer guides & more to build on the Permaweb. All in one place.

- [AO Cookbook](https://cookbook_ao.g8way.io/): a developer guide for building applications on AO.

- [GraphQL](https://arweave.net/graphql) helps create custom queries to retrieve specific data from the Arweave network as per the applications needs.

- [Gateways](https://www.notion.so/ad35c252a148482bb298448c7adf359c?pvs=21) act as a bridge between the applications and users with the underlying Arweave network. They facilitate serving, processing and retrieving of data on Arweave.

- [Bundlers](https://www.notion.so/1eb56846c7714052bac7eaf4e3f6e9c9?pvs=21) package multiple data items into one single transaction that help reduce the transaction fees and boost scalability of applications.

The Arweave and AO ecosystem has numerous community driven specifications that serve as best practices for various common features like formatting of data, on-chain licensing, interaction between contracts, building layer 2 services etc.
