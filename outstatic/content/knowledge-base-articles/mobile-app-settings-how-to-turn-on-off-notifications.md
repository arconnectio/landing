During onboarding, ArConnect users will have the opportunity to enable notifications. However, if an ArConnect user changes their mind and wants to enable or disable notifications in the future, it can be done via the mobile app Settings:<br>

<br>

ArConnect users can enable or disable notifications by:

- Opening the ArConnect Mobile App

- Click on the Settings menu in the upper left hand corner of the Dashboard

- Select Notifications in the Quick Settings menu

- Enable or disable notifications with the notifications toggle

- If enabled, decide what type of notifications to receive

- Finished
