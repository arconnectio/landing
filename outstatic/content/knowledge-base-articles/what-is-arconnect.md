- [ArConnect](https://www.arconnect.io/?utm_source=ArConnect+Knowledgebase+Docs&utm_medium=Doc+Page&utm_campaign=ArConnect+Knowledge+Base&utm_id=ArConnect+Knowledgebase) is a browser extension and mobile app self custody wallet.

    - Browser Extension

        - We use the browser’s native extension API to create a secure bridge between your wallet and applications.

            - This makes the wallet environment isolated and safe.

            - Provides indirect, regulated access to your wallet, instead of direct unsafe access.

            - Allows the implementation of middlewares to further secure the connection with your wallet.

            - This requires implementation from the applications.
