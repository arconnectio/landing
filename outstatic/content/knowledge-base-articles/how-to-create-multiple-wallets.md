Arweave is similar to Ethereum where it is account based and not [UTXO](https://www.ledger.com/academy/glossary/unspent-transaction-output-utxo).

Within [ArConnect](https://www.arconnect.io/), you can create multiple wallets. Each wallet has itâ€™s own:

- Seed phrase / key file

- Different address

To implement this, go to Settings > Wallets and tap Add wallet

Make sure to use the same password that you created your ArConnect wallet. You **do not** create a new password despite creating a new seed phrase.
